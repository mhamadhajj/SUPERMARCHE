<h1 class="black">ABOUT US</h1>
<p class="txt">High quality. Low prices. Hassle-free shopping that gets you in and out. A product assortment and store layout that’s refreshingly simple, yet full of surprises to discover at every visit. Lidl is not your cookie-cutter grocery store. We’re revolutionizing grocery shopping. We have a less complicated process that allows us to simply deliver low prices, high quality, and the best shopping experience for our customers. Here’s how we do it:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>We’re expert product curators. Instead of offering a myriad of brands in every category, our stores offer carefully curated selections that are top-quality and best-prices. So your precious time is not spent sifting through endless versions of products you don’t want.</li>
<li>You’re busy. We get it. That’s why we’re masters of store efficiency. All our stores have the same intuitive layout, making it easier for you to find what you need quickly.</li>
<li>You’ll notice while shopping that most of our assortment is our own private label - around 80% of our products, in fact. This means we’ve especially developed these products to match our high standards and allows us direct oversight of product integrity. Each product undergoes a rigorous testing regimen, which includes taste, quality and sensory testing.</li>
<li>We keep overhead to a minimum and eliminate any unnecessary costs. Take our “bring your own bag” policy. Not only does it mean we don’t build the cost of bags into our prices, this policy also saves you time at the register and is a greener solution. Additionally, we display our products in custom boxes instead of replenishing and stocking item by item. Our associates simply replace the boxes as needed, saving hours every week on stocking shelves.</li>
